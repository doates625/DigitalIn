Written by Dan Oates (WPI Class of 2020)

### Description
This class implements the Mbed DigitalIn class for Arduino to allow for cross-platform libraries. Additionally, the type PinMode from Mbed is defined in this file. For the Mbed platform, PinMode can be one of:

- PullUp
- PullDown
- PullNone
- OpenDrain

For Arduino, only PullUp and PullNone are supported.
